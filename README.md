TrackerApp: Real-time trip tracking app for PhoneGap

This app is a working concept for a tracking system that gives you real-time updates about your trip with Dutch public transit, for example about delays on your route. The main goal of the project is to demonstrate features. It is being developed full time at Eindhoven University of Technology by a team of students, commissioned by a group of stakeholders including the Province of North Brabant. 

Please build the app using PhoneGap for your device and let us know about any issues, and feel free to check out our stuff and use it however you want. If you have any trouble at all, let us know! You can find us in IRC at irc://cup-a-sep.nl/#chat
